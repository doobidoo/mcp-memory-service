  "content": "# Requirements Document: Codebase Remediation\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis spec defines the requirements for remediating the MCP Memory Service codebase. The service has grown to 34,233 lines with ~45% dead code, 3 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities, 4 unused storage backends, and 15 configuration classes. This remediation will reduce the codebase to ~2,000 lines while maintaining all core functionality.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nPer `product.md`, this remediation directly supports:\n- **Reduce Technical Debt**: 94% line reduction (34K → ~2K)\n- **Eliminate Security Risk**: Fix all CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities\n- **Simplify Operations**: 1-2 storage backends vs 4\n- **Enable V2**: Clean foundation for GPU acceleration, memory graphs\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Security Vulnerability Elimination\n\n**User Story:** As a self-hoster, I want all CRITICAL and HIGH security vulnerabilities fixed, so that my memory service doesn't expose my infrastructure to attack.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL NOT load any code with CRITICAL vulnerabilities (authlib, python-jose)\n2. WHEN anonymous access is configured THEN the system SHALL grant read-only permissions, NOT admin access\n3. WHEN CORS is not explicitly configured THEN the system SHALL default to empty allowed origins `[]`, NOT wildcard `['*']`\n4. WHEN the service runs THEN the system SHALL NOT expose mDNS discovery on the network\n\n### REQ-2: Dead Code Removal\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want all dead code removed, so that the codebase is understandable and maintainable.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL contain zero unused modules (consolidation/, discovery/, sync/, ingestion/, embeddings/onnx_*)\n2. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL contain zero duplicate server implementations (only one entry point)\n3. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL contain no disabled-by-default features (consolidation, forgetting, SSE events)\n4. IF a module is not imported anywhere THEN the system SHALL NOT include it in the final codebase\n\n### REQ-3: Storage Backend Consolidation\n\n**User Story:** As an operator, I want only the storage backends I use, so that I don't maintain code for features I never deploy.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL support Qdrant as the primary storage backend\n2. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL support SQLite-vec as a zero-dependency local option\n3. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain Cloudflare, Hybrid, or HTTP client storage backends\n4. WHEN storage is configured THEN the system SHALL use a `typing.Protocol` interface for backend abstraction\n\n### REQ-4: Configuration Simplification\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear, minimal configuration, so that I can understand and modify settings without confusion.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use at most 4 Settings classes (Core, Qdrant, SQLite, Embedding)\n2. WHEN sensitive values are configured THEN the system SHALL use `SecretStr` for secrets (API keys, tokens)\n3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all settings via pydantic-settings\n4. IF a configuration option is unused THEN the system SHALL NOT include it\n\n### REQ-5: Architecture Alignment\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean hexagonal architecture, so that business logic is isolated from protocol and storage concerns.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN business logic executes THEN `service.py` SHALL NOT import MCP, HTTP, or storage implementation modules\n2. WHEN a new protocol adapter is added THEN the system SHALL require changes only in the `api/` directory\n3. WHEN a new storage backend is added THEN the system SHALL require changes only in the `storage/` directory\n4. WHEN the core is tested THEN tests SHALL NOT require MCP or storage infrastructure\n\n### REQ-6: Line Count Target\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a minimal codebase, so that cognitive load is reduced and bugs are fewer.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the remediation is complete THEN the codebase SHALL contain approximately 2,000 lines (±500)\n2. WHEN individual files are measured THEN each SHALL stay within hard limits defined in `structure.md`\n3. IF a file exceeds its hard limit THEN the system SHALL be refactored to distribute responsibility\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: `service.py` handles business logic only; adapters handle protocol translation only\n- **Modular Design**: Storage backends are interchangeable via Protocol interface\n- **Dependency Management**: Dependency arrows flow inward (api → service → storage interface)\n- **Clear Interfaces**: `BaseStorage` Protocol defines the storage contract\n\n### Performance\n- Embedding generation latency: Establish baseline, maintain or improve post-remediation\n- Memory store/retrieve operations: Establish baseline, maintain or improve post-remediation\n- Container startup time: Target under 30 seconds with model loading\n\n### Security\n- All sensitive configuration uses `SecretStr`\n- No timing attacks on secret comparison (use `secrets.compare_digest`)\n- Parameterized SQL queries only (no string interpolation)\n- API key authentication for all non-health endpoints\n\n### Reliability\n- Health endpoint `/health` returns within 100ms\n- Storage failures surface immediately (no silent failures)\n- Graceful degradation if embedding model fails to load\n\n### Usability\n- Single `uv run memory server` command starts the service\n- Clear error messages with actionable remediation steps\n- Configuration validated at startup, not at first use\n",
