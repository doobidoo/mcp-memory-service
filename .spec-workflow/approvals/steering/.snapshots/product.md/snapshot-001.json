It allows AI assistants to store information, retrieve it via semantic similarity, and maintain context across conversations.\n\n**Current State Problem**: The codebase has ballooned to 34,233 lines with ~45% dead code, 4 unused storage backends, and 3 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities. This remediation project will reduce the codebase to ~5,000 lines while maintaining core functionality.\n\n## Target Users\n\n1. **Claude Code Users** - Developers using Claude Code who need persistent memory across sessions\n2. **MCP Ecosystem** - Any MCP-compatible AI client needing semantic memory capabilities\n3. **Self-Hosters** - Users running their own infrastructure who need a lightweight, reliable memory backend\n\n**User Pain Points (Current)**:\n- Bloated container with unused features\n- Security vulnerabilities in disabled OAuth code\n- Confusing configuration with 15+ settings classes\n- Multiple storage backends creating maintenance burden\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Core (KEEP - V1)\n1. **Semantic Memory Storage**: Store content with automatic vector embedding generation\n2. **Semantic Retrieval**: Find memories by meaning using cosine similarity\n3. **Tag-Based Search**: Categorical filtering with AND/OR logic\n4. **Memory Management**: List, delete, and health-check operations\n5. **TOON Formatting**: Token-efficient output format for LLM consumption\n\n### Features to DELETE\n- OAuth 2.1 (3 CRITICAL vulns, disabled in production)\n- mDNS Discovery (k8s handles this, security risk)\n- Consolidation/Forgetting (disabled by default, premature optimization)\n- Document Ingestion (separate concern, feature creep)\n- 3 of 4 storage backends (Cloudflare, Hybrid, HTTP client)\n- SSE real-time events (YAGNI)\n\n### V2 Vision (After Remediation)\n1. **GPU Encode/Decode**: CUDA acceleration for embeddings\n2. **Memory Graph Matching**: Relationships between memories\n3. **Universal Integrations**: Reflect.app, CI/CD webhooks\n4. **Hardware Optimization**: ARM64/GPU-optimized deployments\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n1. **Reduce Technical Debt**: 85% line reduction (34K → 5K)\n2. **Eliminate Security Risk**: Fix 3 CRITICAL, 4 HIGH vulnerabilities\n3. **Simplify Operations**: 1-2 storage backends vs 4\n4. **Lower Maintenance**: Single-purpose, SOLID architecture\n5. **Enable V2**: Clean foundation for advanced features\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|---------|--------|-------------|\n| Lines of Code | 34,233 | ~5,000 | `wc -l` on src/ |\n| Dead Code | ~45% | 0% | Coverage + static analysis |\n| CRITICAL Vulns | 3 | 0 | Security audit |\n| Storage Backends | 4 | 1-2 | Code inspection |\n| Config Classes | 15 | 3-4 | Code inspection |\n| Container Size | ~2GB | <500MB | `docker images` |\n| Test Coverage | Unknown | >80% | pytest-cov |\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **KISS**: Simplest solution that works. No premature abstraction.\n2. **YAGNI**: Build only what's needed NOW. V2 features wait for V2.\n3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one job, does it well.\n4. **Data is Sacred**: Memory content is never lost. Migrations are safe.\n5. **Fail Loudly**: No silent failures. Errors surface immediately.\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Web-based (existing, needs audit/fix or deletion)\n- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for memory operations\n- **Key Metrics**: Memory count, storage health, embedding latency\n- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` for k8s probes\n\n**Decision Pending**: Dashboard is reportedly broken. Either fix it properly or delete it entirely. No half-measures.\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### V2 Roadmap (Post-Remediation)\n\n1. **GPU Acceleration**\n   - CUDA tensor support in sentence-transformers\n   - fastembed with ONNX GPU backend\n   - Batch embedding for bulk operations\n\n2. **Memory Graph**\n   - `relationships` field in Qdrant payloads\n   - Graph queries for connected memories\n   - Temporal and semantic clustering\n\n3. **Universal Integration**\n   - Webhook dispatch on store/retrieve events\n   - Reflect.app API polling\n   - GitHub/GitLab CI/CD memory injection\n\n### Phased Approach\n\n| Phase | Focus | Outcome |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| 0 | Security Triage | Fix CRITICAL vulns TODAY |\n| 1 | Mass Deletion | Remove ~17K lines of dead code |\n| 2 | Config Collapse | 15 classes → 4 |\n| 3 | Storage Consolidation | Qdrant primary, SQLite dev-only |\n| 4 | V2 Features | GPU, graph, integrations |\n",
