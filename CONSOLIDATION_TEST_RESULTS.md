## How to Use the System

The consolidation system is now fully configured and ready to use. You have two options:

### Option 1: Via MCP Tools (Recommended)

**Restart Claude Code** to activate the 7 consolidation tools:

1. **Get Recommendations** (start here):
   ```
   # Via command palette or tool invocation
   Tool: consolidation_recommendations
   Args: {"time_horizon": "weekly"}
   ```

2. **Check System Status**:
   ```
   Tool: consolidation_status
   Args: {}
   ```

3. **Run Consolidation**:
   ```
   Tool: consolidate_memories
   Args: {"time_horizon": "daily"}
   ```

4. **View Scheduler**:
   ```
   Tool: scheduler_status
   Args: {}
   ```

5. **Manual Trigger**:
   ```
   Tool: trigger_consolidation
   Args: {"time_horizon": "weekly", "immediate": true}
   ```

6. **Pause/Resume**:
   ```
   Tool: pause_consolidation
   Tool: resume_consolidation
   ```

### Option 2: Via Python Script

For advanced testing or automation:

```bash
cd <project-root>

# Run full consolidation test
uv run python /tmp/test_consolidation.py
```

## What Consolidation Will Do

When you run consolidation on your 1773 memories:

### 1. Exponential Decay Scoring
- Calculate relevance for each memory based on age
- Apply retention periods (critical: 365d, standard: 30d, etc.)
- Boost scores for connected and frequently accessed memories

### 2. Creative Association Discovery
- Randomly pair memories to find non-obvious connections
- Focus on 0.3-0.7 similarity range (sweet spot)
- Create association memories linking related content
- Expected: 10-50 new associations

### 3. Semantic Clustering
- Group related memories using DBSCAN algorithm
- Minimum cluster size: 5 memories
- Extract theme keywords for each cluster
- Expected: 20-100 clusters

### 4. Semantic Compression
- Condense memory clusters into summaries
- Max summary length: 500 characters
- Preserve original memories (safe)
- Expected: 10-50 compressed summaries

### 5. Controlled Forgetting
- Archive memories below relevance threshold (0.1)
- Archive memories not accessed in 90+ days
- Never delete protected tags (critical, important, reference)
- Everything recoverable from archive
- Expected: 5-20 archived memories (first run)

## Expected Performance

Based on 1773 memories:

- **Processing time**: 30-120 seconds (daily horizon)
- **Memory throughput**: 15-60 memories/second
- **Associations discovered**: 10-50 new connections
- **Clusters created**: 20-100 semantic groups
- **Memories archived**: 5-20 (first run, more on subsequent runs)

## Safety Features Active

- ✅ Nothing permanently deleted
- ✅ All operations logged
- ✅ Protected memory types immune
- ✅ Archive with recovery
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Rollback capability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Test with recommendations** first to see system suggestions
2. **Run daily consolidation** (lightest processing)
3. **Review discovered associations**
4. **Check what was archived**

### After Testing

1. **Enable weekly scheduling** if satisfied:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env
   MCP_SCHEDULE_WEEKLY=SUN 03:00

   # Reconnect MCP
   /mcp
   ```

2. **Monitor health regularly**:
   - Use `consolidation_status` tool
   - Check archive directory
   - Review performance metrics

3. **Adjust configuration** based on results:
   - Fine-tune similarity ranges
   - Adjust retention periods
   - Modify relevance thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Available

If consolidation tools don't appear:
1. Restart Claude Code completely (not just `/mcp`)
2. Check `~/.claude.json` has environment variables
3. Verify with: `uv run python /tmp/test_consolidation_simple.py`

### Consolidation Taking Too Long

Expected for first run with 1773 memories:
- Daily horizon: 30-120 seconds
- Weekly horizon: 60-240 seconds
- Be patient on first run (embeddings, clustering)

### No Associations Found

Normal if:
- Memories are very dissimilar
- Database is small (<100 memories)
- All memories are very new (same topics)

Try weekly or monthly horizon for better results.
