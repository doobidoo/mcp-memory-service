## Release Philosophy

**KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID** - We ship what users need, not what we think is clever.

- **Breaking changes**: Major version bumps with migration guides
- **Feature additions**: Minor version bumps with backward compatibility
- **Bug fixes**: Patch version bumps
- **No bloat**: Every feature must solve a real user problem
